# Improving Detection of Virus Integration in Tumor Genomes using Deep Learning  



Pathogenic viruses pose significant threats to public health throughout the world.1–5 Some of them causally link to human oncogenesis. For example, human papillomavirus (HPV) causes 91 percent of cases of cervical cancer, the fourth most common cancer in women globally.3,4 In cervical cancer and some other viral mediated cancers, viruses can integrate their genetic material into host cell genome.6–11  The process of viral integration causes damages to the host cell DNA and increases the risk of cancer-promoting changes occurring in the host genome.8,9 Therefore, to understand the molecular mechanisms of viral mediated cancers, a necessary step is to detect viruses and their insertion sites in cancer genomes. With rapid advances in next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies over the past two decades and their increasingly widespread applications in hospitals, many NGS-based tools were developed to detect viruses and their insertion sites.6,12–26 NGS has the potential to unbiasedly and comprehensively identify pathogens in clinical samples. But due to the challenge of accurate detection, the sensitivity of today’s tools is still not satisfactory27,28, not matching that of the established quantitative technologies.
